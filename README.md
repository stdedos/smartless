# smartless

`smartless` is a pager that behaves just like `less`, but will show the file (or output) directly to the terminal if it is short enough to fit in the terminal height.  For longer files, the pager is still invoked.

Here is a small demo, and I have also written a [blog post](http://stefanheule.com/blog/posts/2015-06-07/smartless-a-better-pager-for-small-and-large-inputs/) about this project.

## Prerequisites

`smartless` requires a reasonable resent version of `bash`, and a pager like `less`.  Both are available by default on most unix systems.

## Installation

The simplest way to install the script is to download it directly into /usr/local/bin:

    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stefanheule/smartless/master/smartless -o /usr/local/bin/smartless
    chmod +x /usr/local/bin/smartless # <-- mark it as executable

Alternatively, you can clone the git repository, which allows easy updating by doing `git pull`:

    git clone https://github.com/stefanheule/smartless.git
    ln -s $PWD/smartless/smartless /usr/local/bin/smartless # <-- make it available system-wide as "smartless"
    
See also the [aliases](#aliases) section below.

## Usage

`smartless` is designed as a drop-in replacement for `less`.  For instance, to view the output of a command `cmd`, use

```bash
cmd | smartless
```

It is also possible to pass a filename directly:

```bash
smartless file.txt
```

Finally, all other parameters are forwarded to the pager.  For instance, `smartless +G` will jump to the end of the file in `less`.

### Aliases

To replace less completely, it is possible to define an alias in most shells.  For bash and zsh, the following line will allow the usage of `smartless` when typing `less`.

```bash
alias less='/path/to/smartless'
```

It can be useful to define an additional alias for jumping directly to the end of the input.  I like to call that alias `more`, but other more descriptive names are imaginable:

```bash
alias more='/path/to/smartless +G'
```

## Configuration

Several optional environment variables control `smartless`.  These are described here, including their default values.

```bash
# number of lines to directly display before entering the pager
SMARTLESS_NUM_LINES= # (terminal height - 5) or 15, if terminal height cannot be discovered automatically
# '-H' (one of the few arguments that less does not accept) or
# --hold-pollute (coming from -H) modifies this by
# outputting to half the screen instead of filling it up

# the pager to be used
SMARTLESS_PAGER='less'

# the default arguments to the pager
SMARTLESS_PAGER_ARGUMENTS='-iR'

# Prompt text when switching to pager:
# 0: no prompt
# 1: prompt partial text only
# 2: partial text + more... text
SMARTLESS_PROMPT_PAGER=2

# ... more in pager prompt color (set empty for no color)
SMARTLESS_PROMPT_COLOR="\033[38;5;2m"
```
